<p>Software Developer, currently based near Washington D.C. Ardent supporter of Arsenal F.C., an introvert at heart, and find solace in writing about stuff I feel passionate about. </p>

<p>Originally from the city of Lucknow, India, I moved to the United States in 2014 to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science. </p>

<p>Moving halfway across the world was especially difficult, for an introvert, inexperienced privileged to the extent of being spoilt, Indian guy. 
As a part of this blog, I plan to share to the best of my ability, my experiences and sincerely hope they can help somebody in a similar boat sometime.  </p>

<p class="mb-5">And when I am not writing about my experiences, you can find me pouring my heart out about Arsenal or Football in my blog posts.  </p>
