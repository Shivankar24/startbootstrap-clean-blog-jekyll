<p>As I begin to write this, I am sitting in my apartment near Washington DC on a Sunday evening, alone, sipping on Chai, with a wide range of thoughts rushing through my head. I came to the US over 4 years ago, as a completely different person, in comparison to who I am today. I wanted to do my Masters in Computer Science from the United States, and succeeded in doing that much at least. I got a job, settled here or was settled there at least when I wrote this, but often imagined a different life for myself, a different path. Whenever I go back to India, I often get asked the same question by some aspiring young Engineer or some young kid in school: ‘Was it worth it?’</p>

<p>To almost all of them, my reply is just a simple shrug of shoulders, which is as honest as I can possibly get. In words, my answer is, I don’t know.  I have done a lot of things I am proud of here, a lot of things I am not so proud of, and a bunch of other things I did, I have no clue why. I cannot tell you whether in the end, it will be worth it or not.  </p>

<p>But I can tell you about my journey, about my experiences, and about how I got to where I am today. Maybe they will help you if you ever decide to move halfway across the world, maybe not. But maybe, just maybe, after going through what I have to say, you can judge for yourself.</p>

<h2>Chapter 1: The back-story and the departure</h2>

<p>I was not sure of what I was doing. Was I doing the right thing? Or would this entire thing turn out to be a complete fiasco? I have to tell you, that I am being completely honest, when I say that I had absolutely no idea. In fact, there was a voice at the back of my head telling me that this would not pan out very well. But I made sure to drown out that voice with a hundred other things that were on my mind at that time; not just because it made me feel uneasy, but because I felt that the voice was actually making sense.</p>

<p>It was 11 o'clock in the night in New Delhi sometime in the August of 2014 and I was heading towards the Indira Gandhi international airport with my father, about to embark on a journey, which would take me halfway across the world to the United States. I had given up a reasonably stable job and life in the Indian IT Sector, where I had lived life king size in the city of Chandigarh, with a wonderful group of friends and the cheapest booze in the country, to pursue a Masters’ degree in the United States.</p>

<p>Not a single one of all the steps leading up to this moment had been an easy one.</p>

<p>To begin with, while I had been working, I had applied to a number of Universities in the US but had got rejections from all but two till the month of January in the year 2014. The work I had been doing at my job was not very challenging, the working hours were not the best, and I felt choked in a never ending rat race. I did not mind the former two, but it was the latter that really got to me and after one particularly nasty day which involved me being shouted upon by a random guy and a random girl in my team for some random reason, I was sure I had had enough. It was my birthday the next day and I was leaving for my hometown of Lucknow that night. But that day at work made me put in a resignation, a figurative one in my mind at least, before I left. I went home, had loads of fun with people I had known all my life which included both friends and family, then returned to Chandigarh after a week and the first thing I did after returning was put in my papers. I was done.  I had not gotten into 6 of the 8 universities I had applied to, but I was sure I was not going to take shit like this at work, even if I got through none of them. Or so I had thought.</p>

<p>I had a two month notice period to serve before I could actually leave the company, and a week into it, I got a reject from the 7th University and my instant reaction was, pardon my language, fuck. I had just one more result to go and I was fairly confident now of keeping my record of a 100 percent in terms of rejection, intact. Did I ever reconsider withdrawing my resignation? The thought did cross my mind, yes; but it was never strong enough to actually make me do it. I was through with that job. And I was actually prepared to sit at home and figure out my life when life threw another curve ball at me. I actually got an admit! Yes, I did! I was obviously over the moon and owing to this new found happiness, the first thing I did was that I planned a 5 day trip to Goa with a bunch of College friends. What this admission would actually mean for me had not really sunk in yet and neither did I try very hard to be honest. But in hindsight, I am glad it didn’t since those turned out to be some of the best days of my life. I goofed around at work during the notice period, went over to my friends’ place in Chandigarh ever so often, and was just really happy with life in general. I felt I had actually achieved something significant in my life now and thus my elation was understandable. I completed my notice period, which was marked by a farewell cake and a handmade card by a few of my friends, which I still have with me; a very kind and thoughtful gesture indeed, and went back home, happy to have ended a rather torrid time as far as my professional life was concerned. But little did I know that a new era of torrid times was about to dawn on me.</p>

<p>Now in order to set things in perspective, I would like to go a little deeper into my background. My parents had never really put any kind of pressure on me whatsoever. I had never even made a packet of maggi on my own and I am pretty sure I would not have been able to differentiate between dhaniya and pudina at that time. Actually, I still might not, but I think you get the point. My father was an employee of the Indian Government and thus, me and my siblings had had it pretty easy so far, whether it was getting a reservation on a train or getting a license made; living easy on the age old Indian concept of jugaad. I wouldn’t go as far as saying that I was a spoilt brat, but I was definitely useless and my parents were well aware of that. But now that I had decided to travel abroad for higher education, I got more on my plate than I had bargained for, which I had not realized earlier. I obviously had to get a lot of stuff done before I could actually leave the country. So far, I had been under the impression that I will just go to an American University and slide into the American lifestyle, Uncle Sam welcoming me with open arms, which was a long way from reality. Also, you should know that my father seemed to be carrying (the right in hindsight) notion that managing all of this on my own would prove to be too much for me. I couldn’t see what all the fuss was about and was reasonably confident of managing all this stuff with ease. Needless to say, I had never been more wrong in my life.</p>

<p>Thus, began one of the most hectic months of my life, where I was actually required to go to places and figure stuff out for myself; which ranged from getting an education loan sanctioned at a bank to getting a foreign travel card and figuring out the VISA process, before I could even think of booking a flight to actually get to the States. I had collected more documents in that period of time than I had seen in my life altogether and when I got even the slightest of things wrong, boy was my father ready to pounce! I think I got a telling off every second day from him for things like wrong documents, less documents, no documents and god knows what not! It was his own way of preparing me for what was about to come I suppose, which I did not appreciate at the time, but I sure as hell do now.</p>

<p>Now, in order to understand what is to come, I should also give you background about how my brain was wired at that time, which may not be the most entertaining stuff you read today, but since you are reading something I wrote about my experiences in the United States, I figured you might as well. I went to school in the city of Lucknow, in an all boys’ school, and did absolutely nothing except going from school to home and home to school. I was actually the boring kid at school, but I was not really geeky. I played more than my fair share of sports and made some very good friends at that time which remain very dear, loyal and close to me to this day. The same applies to me when I went to College in Noida, but I was not the boring kid I used to be anymore. I wasn’t the kind who got into alcohol and drugs, but I sure did learn to have fun, which everybody does in College I suppose. Again, I made some very good friends and these friends were to be the benchmark for all my social interactions in the future and somehow, my brain was wired to think that these were the kind of people I would meet in the future, and these would be the kind of relationships I would forge all through my life. I am not saying that’s how everybody’s brain works, but that’s certainly how mine did at that time. I did not even consider the possibility of meeting people who may be different from the ones I had met so far, not because I didn’t want to but simply because I couldn’t comprehend it. I was young and stupid, so it was kind of expected, but this was a bit too stupid on the scale of normal people.</p>

<p>Back to that warm summer night in New Delhi now. There were very few things that me and my father agreed on at that time, and I guess things remain similar on that front to this day. My father was not really pleased at the prospect of me going over to another part of the world to study, and spending a shit load of money in doing so. He had his reasons, which I won’t say didn’t make sense, but they were made from a completely different perspective, which I understand now. His logic was based on the fact that even If I did make it big there, who would really care? “jungle me mor nacha kisne dekha” were his exact words I believe. Everybody I had ever known, friends and family, were all here in India. I, on the other hand, was just plain stupid. I had this image of the so called American dream in my mind that had overpowered all sense and logic. In simple words, the events leading up to this day were anything but smooth sailing. And making things worse was the fact that now, as we moved closer to the airport, I could suddenly see what my father meant. I had an overflow of emotions at that time some of which were as follows: My father is right! Why was I doing this?! Why do I need to leave my country and everything I have known so far?! I should not be doing this at all! What an amazingly stupid thing to do!</p>

<p>And that, my friends, was the first time I had a panic attack in my life, of which there were plenty more to come in the next few years. My tickets were booked, my passport had an American student visa stamped on it, and I was on my way to the airport; when I had this thought of just letting it all go and make a run for it. But I knew there was no turning back now. I noticed each and everything about Delhi in that particular car ride and although I will try, I don’t think I can explain in words, the perspective with which I was looking at things that night and that entire day in fact. I have had a particular affection for the city of New Delhi. It is very much like a second home to me. It was here that I actually learned how to have fun. Like I have already mentioned, during my undergrad, I made some very good friends with whom I had roamed around the streets of this city, and made some wonderful memories along the way. And all those memories were coming flooding back to me while I passed through the streets. Every road side chatwala reminded me of all the midnight snacks I had ever had with my friends on similar roadside shops and dhabas. I could see a number of young boys roaming around on their activas and bikes and couldn’t help remembering how often during my 4 years of college I had done the same. There was a feeling of being invincible in me at that time, as if life and its reality could not touch me and it was thus very hard for me to be down. That is how youth is in its mighty exuberance. I say that as if I am an eighty year old man even though I am still only 28 but believe me, I have experienced it. The moment you walk out of your college, you get the first taste of a reality check in your life and it is not fun at all. All this reminded me of the fact that I had actually decided to walk away from my friends on my own; a decision which I was resenting while I was in the car which was slowly taking me away from everything I have ever known.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an eternity, the car stopped at T-3 and my brain just went numb, which was more of a relief than an inconvenience.  As it is, the poor thing had worked overtime on my way to the airport and may have short-circuited in the process. Honestly speaking, everything from the point I got out of the car to the airplane taking off is a blur to me. I remember just going through the motions at the airport, greeting my father before leaving, flashing my passport to people who demanded it, going through security checkpoints, letting people frisk me, and somehow getting to the gate where my airplane was to take off from. I could see a lot of shops, people and restaurants all around me but I could not quite process the surroundings at that time. It took me a couple of hours to regain my composure and actually think calmly about my life and the changes that were about to hit me real hard  and what unnerved me was the fact that I wasn’t quite sure whether I was ready for them. I also took a couple of McSpicy Paneer burgers from McDonalds as I was not sure when I’ll get a chance to have them again. I ate one, and stored the other one for my stop at the London airport, not knowing what I’ll get to eat there. Yup, that McSpicy burger travelled halfway around the globe with me!</p>

<p>This brings me to the next big leap that everybody has to take while leaving their country. For anybody who is planning to go anywhere outside India for higher Education or for some other reason requiring a long term, I have a piece of advice for you. Consider this question: Can you guess what the worst part of the entire departure process from the country is? I assure you, that this is one question nobody thinks about right up until they are having the harrowing experience of actually going through it. Nobody pauses and thinks even for a second, how hard it will be for them to make an absolutely brand new start. I did not either. My answer, of course is based on my experiences, and I’d like to use that experience to advise anyone who plans to undertake this challenge.</p>

<p>The Answer to my question earlier? It’s the God. Damn. Take off.</p>

<p>They say that your life flashes before your eyes in your final moments. I can’t say whether or not that’s true, but I can certainly say that I did have a premature flashback of my short life much earlier than I had anticipated. Once that airplane started moving, I got a sense of finality in all the decisions I had made leading up to that moment. I started seeing all the things I was going to miss. My friends, my girlfriend, all the friends I had made throughout my life, the street food, the games of cricket and football, and every little thing that I had taken for granted all my life. Trust me, that take off is one of the worst things one can ever feel in his/her life. Intentionally walking away from all the people you have ever known is something nobody is prepared for.  As the plane started gaining speed, I have no shame in admitting that I fought back tears as I peered out of the window. And to add to all the drama, take offs and landings scare the hell out of me, every single time. Awesome, right? The plane took off, and I could see the city of New Delhi getting smaller and smaller below me. As the lights and New Delhi diminished, so did whatever was left of my enthusiasm of going to the States. I was now absolutely certain I had taken the wrong decision.</p>

<p>I am kind of amazed how my tiny little brain could manage to cram all those thoughts and emotions inside it over the course of one night. But, I am pretty sure that these or even more thoughts and emotions are felt by each individual who decides to take the drastic step of going overseas. For me, I was simply not mature enough to understand the ramifications of going abroad. I was happy with the fact that I was one step closer to the so called “American dream”, which had already come crashing down on me.</p>

<p>My point in mentioning all of this is, that it takes a lot out of you when you’re about to leave your country. No matter how much you bash India, or how pissed you are with the state of the country, the politics, the people or the infrastructure,  you sure as hell will realize what it’s worth the instant your airplane takes off to take you to some foreign land. Before ever taking a decision of this magnitude, I urge you to do something which I foolishly did not: think it over and prepare yourself.</p>
