<p>Damn. Rooney should have won it for DC! New England Revolution, playing a man short, were sitting back for the entirety of the second half, trying to hold on to their one goal advantage, with the scoreline being a close 2-1. This could go either way, with New England getting more than their fair share of decent chances on the counter attack, while DC were going in for the kill.  And then, in a dramatic turn of events in the 87th minute, Wayne Rooney, the Manchester United legend and DC's marquee signing, provided an excellent ball from a free kick near the halfway line, for Quincy Amarikwa to equalize! Audi field was going crazy! Rooney had done it again, just a few weeks after scoring a wonder goal from the halfway line! And while this happened, an Indian guy from the city of Lucknow, a die hard fan of London based football club Arsenal F.C, living somewhere near Washington D.C in the United States, went crazy in his living room! How, you might ask, was this connection formed? That, my friends, is the power of football. .</p>

<p>I am sure you've heard it a million times already, but I am still going to say it anyway: Football knows no boundaries, no borders. It is the one truly global game, the game of the people, for the people and by the people. Whether it is the streets of New Delhi or Rio de Janeiro, or a turf in New York City or a basketball court in London, there will always be a bunch of kids (or adults) running around after a football, trying out all sorts of fancy tricks and flicks they have seen Mo Salah pull off for Liverpool in the Premier League in England, or try to chip the goal keeper like Messi, which he has quite frankly made a habit of. A majority of these people may be living a life of turmoil off the pitch, but if you see them when they're running with the ball at their feet, I doubt you'll ever be able to tell which ones they are. </p>

<p>I, personally, got into football relatively later in life. Like I said earlier, I am from India, and if we Indians are more passionate about anything apart from our own religions, it is the religion of cricket. Like every other kid in India, I idolized the likes of Dravid and Tendulkar growing up, the stalwarts of the Indian cricket team. I lived through the countless failures of an average Indian cricket team in the 90's, until the golden age dawned on us, and India became a cricketing superpower. The rise of the Kohlis and the Dhonis meant that India were not the meek opponents they used to be anymore, and were beating teams left, right and center. And I, along with a billion other Indian Cricket fanatics, had never been happier! It was during this time, as an 18 year old, with the advent of the numerous sports broadcasting channels in India, combined with all the hooplah of the 2006 FIFA world cup, I got curious about the game of football. Quite frankly, I could not understand what all the fuss was about. I was still more interested in a day 5 of test cricket, with the spinners bowling in the rough to get wickets, and the batsmen leaving ball after ball to get through the final few sessions of the game, rather than a premier league game in England. But, I really did want to try and follow football for a bit, just to see if I could understand why there were kids in school, getting super excited about a bloke called Thierry Henry, playing for some team in England called "Arsenal".</p>

<p>The 2006 FIFA World cup, the pinnacle of all sporting events on Earth, gave me that opportunity. Like the countless other people on the planet who have no team to support in the tournament, I went for the ones I thought were the strongest: Spain. And like every wannabe soccer fan that I meet today, who have that one soccer jersey of a European super club, and claim to be die hard "fans", I went out with my father to buy myself a Spanish jersey, excited for a sporting event other than cricket, for the first time in my life. It was then that I realized how crazily expensive these things were! I got a proper telling off from my father as a bonus, for wanting to waste money on a jersey being sold at 10 times its value. I watched in agony as Spain were knocked out by France in the round of 16 that summer. The more games I watched, the more I realized what a beautiful game this was! It had everything one could ask for, with skill, stamina and flair being an integral part of it. And that was not all, as there was grit involved as well, with underdog teams like Australia challenging the mighty Italians! </p>

<p>I was still not exactly a proper football fan to be honest. For starters, I did not have a team to support. I had started to watch a bit of the Premier League and was getting to know some of the top teams and players in England, but I had no strong motivation to pick a team yet. My natural instincts were hell bent towards cricket, and I only watched football as a last resort, when I could find no cricket game on television. I was also being a little pretentious at school, throwing in the random "Manchester United", "Giggs", "Chelsea","Henry" or "Gerrard", trying way too hard to barge into football conversations. Courtesy of a simple twist of fate, all of this was about to change.</p>

<p>My father had this habit. Never did he allow me to get anything in one go. He wanted me to understand the value of money before he bought me anything, and he had his own way of getting his point across. Take the Spanish jersey from the 2006 World Cup for example. There was not the slightest chance of me ever getting it at all, and a part of me knew that already, even when I went out with him to get it. But, when he thought it was apt, he had his own way of making up for saying no as well. And he did something similar about 6 months after the world cup. He came home from work one day, with a Nike bag in his hand. I had a couple of friends over and was hanging out with them in my room, when he came in and handed me this bag. He did not say what it was or why he had brought it, just gave me the bag and was on his way. This was how he had always done things. Say no first, make sure a lesson is learnt, and then make up for being too stern. The typical Indian father, and I don't mean that in a bad way. They may not be expressive, but they know whats best for their kids. </p>

<p>I waited till my friends had left to open the bag, and out slid a red and white football jersey, with the words "Fly Emirates" in white across the chest, just below the crest of the club. I knew what club this was, even with my limited knowledge. Arsenal were no unknowns in the Premier League or the world, even if I did not know much about them. </p>

<p>A decade down the line, 17th May 2014. I had still not seen Arsenal lift a trophy in my life as a fan. I had read everything about the history of the club, had the Arsenal stats on my finger tips, and had seen Thierry Henry's glorious goals for Arsenal on youtube, on repeat for almost 10 years. I was about to embark on a journey halfway across the world, having decided to pursue higher Education in the States. But on that day, moving abroad was the least of my concerns. Arsenal had reached the final of the FA cup, and were firm favorites to lift the trophy, against the weaker opposition of Hull City. This could end a 9 year trophy drought for Arsenal, and also give me the satisfaction of seeing a team I fell in love with, because of an accidental jersey, finally lay their hands on silver ware! And boy did they take me on a roller coaster! They were 2-0 down with the first quarter of an hour, only to make a dramatic comeback to make it 2-2 somewhere around the 70th minute! With a lovely back flick from Olivier Giroud, and a silky first time finish from Aaron Ramsey, Arsenal made it 3-2, as I screamed my heart out in my living room! Having endured countless failures and demolitions by vastly superior oppositions, my joy knew no boundaries! And for those few hours, I did not have the slightest of concern about leaving everything I had ever known behind; the only thing that mattered was Arsenal and that victory. </p>

<p>Fast forward another 5 years, and Arsenal had become a cup team, winning 2 more FA cups after their 2014 triumph, but still far from a sustained title challenge. And from that moment on, when I had got that Arsenal jersey, no matter where I went, I was certain of one thing: I will definitely find fellow Gooners to cheer Arsenal on. Whether it was New Delhi, New York or Virginia, I was always able to get together with fellow gooners to catch our beloved Arsenal in action! </p>

<p>Later in life, as fate would have it, I ended up in a city called Sterling in Virginia, a 45 minute drive away from Washington D.C. Major League Soccer had started to gain popularity in recent years, and I had been unlucky to not be able to see Thierry henry play for the New York Red Bulls. He retired the year I moved to the United States, and I cursed my luck for it. D.C United though, the team from Washington D.C, were causing ripples in MLS, with the big money signing of Wayne Rooney. The day he signed for D.C, the news was all over every soccer website you could ever follow, and hence, pretty hard to miss. And I was certainly not going to let another opportunity to see one of the legends of the game, slip by! </p>

<p>September 2018. D.C, a mid table team in the middle of a rebuild, v/s Atlanta, an MLS powerhouse. I knew for a fact that DC had been close to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings the previous season, while Atlanta were closer to the top of the Western Conference almost consistently every year. I did not have high expectations from D.C, nor did I expect myself to be remotely interested in this game. But I did want to see Rooney play, so I went online and got tickets anyway. The ticket prices were surprisingly reasonable, even though I got a pretty good seat for myself, reiterating the fact that ticket sales weren't exactly booming for D.C United. I used to live alone at that time, and I remember feeling a sense of excitement when I got onto the metro to get to the stadium, Audi field. A soccer game, for a soccer fan, is a soccer game after all! So I wasn't going to complain, especially if there was a chance for me to see Rooney run riot! </p>

<p>When I finally did reach the stadium, the atmosphere around the place was electric! There were D.C United jerseys all over, from little kids holding their father's hands, all the way to senior citizens! I could sense that a number of these people had been coming to watch D.C. play for years, simply based on the size of the numerous fan groups I came across. There were a bunch of fans with flags, banners, their faces painted in red and black, the D.C. United colors, and some sporting jerseys from the 90s, when D.C. used to be a soccer powerhouse. Then there were others with drums and vuvuzelas, who were singing and dancing inside the stadium, and chants of all kinds echoing around the place!  </p>

<p>"Vamos! Vamos United! Esta noche Tenemos que ganar!" was one such chant which stayed with me, which roughly translates to "come on United! let's go win tonight!". All of this was surreal to me. I had never actually experienced the kind of feeling that was on display here: local fans supporting their local team, all while being part of one big party! The game began, and I had never had so much fun in my life! 20,000 people behind one team, chanting every play they made, and booing every foul Atlanta committed, and screaming their hearts out at every D.C. goal, or well timed tackle! I could not help but think of the emotions that must be a part of these fans, coming to support their team year after year, generation after generation, passing on the love for their team. And this was one of the younger teams, in a younger league, unlike England, where almost each club is hundreds of years old, with a rich history and countless relegations, promotions, disappointments and elation! 
There was a section of fans, which I later came to know were known as the La Barra Brava, founded in 1995, and were seated, or rather standing, in the bleachers. Every goal was cheered with huge flags being waved by them, beer with the plastic cups being thrown all over the place, and the drums and dancing, which were almost customary. Throughout the duration of the 90 minutes of the game, these guys just did not stop chanting! It was the first time I was seeing such passion in person, and I was in awe of their dedication and energy! </p>

<p>Needless to say, the fans, the stadium, Audi Field, the La Barra Brava, the dancing, the chants, the drums, all had me in love with D.C United in no time! And the icing on the cake was, D.C beat Atlanta 3-0, which sealed the deal! D.C. United had an Indian supporter behind them! 

D.C. United were also the reason for me connecting with a fellow fan at my workplace, and before the pandemic locked us all up and closed everything down, we were regulars at Audi field. And in a weirdly odd coincidence, we shared a love of Arsenal F.C! We became friends because of football, and remain very good friends to this day! Another example, in the long list of countless instances, of football bringing people together! Since then, we have made a habit of making each D.C. United game we go to, a proper game day, meeting up at a bar for pre game, walking to Audi field for the game, and then just soaking in the football! </p>

<p>And our shared love for the game, culminated in a lifelong dream of ours coming true last year,  when we went to Fedex field in Washington D.C., and finally got to see our beloved Arsenal play a friendly against the Los Blancos, Real Madrid! We just could not stop smiling that day! </p>

<p>It goes without saying, once COVID is done and dusted, we will be back in the Audi field stands, sipping beer, when not throwing it in the air that is, screaming our hearts out and cheering every goal and every tackle! And of course, hopefully, some day, we long to  be in the stands of the Emirates stadium in North London, cheering Arsenal on to win a long overdue Premier League title! 
    
<p><Vamos United!</p>

<p>Come on you Gunners!</p>
