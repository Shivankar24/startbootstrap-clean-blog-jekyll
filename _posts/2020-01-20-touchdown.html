<p>I'll be honest. I had not traveled by air much at all when I got on that America bound flight. The few occasions I had traveled, I had a mini heart attack during take off, landing, and every other minor, even mildly out of the ordinary jerk, that the airplane experienced. In a very short 45 minute flight from New Delhi to my hometown of Lucknow a few years ago, one thing had become crystal clear to me: Airplanes were not for me. Now that I was going abroad, I was hit with yet another stark realization: these flights were going to be a lot more frequent and way longer from now on. All my journeys since then, have comprised of an average of 15 hours in the air one way, with minor turbulence here and there, making my heart skip a beat, pretty much in sync with the jerks. Not much fun at all as you can imagine.</p>

<p>That first journey though, was something else altogether. I had not yet realized that sleeping on a plane was impossible for me, so I kept making an effort to try and drift off to sleep, all in vain of course. I was also not aware of the fact that booze was free on international flights so I helped myself to a beer. Or two. Or three. I don't quite remember actually, if you know what I mean. But even then, I was awake throughout the 8 hour flight to London, from where I had a connecting flight to Chicago. The duration of the layover was a couple of hours, more than enough for me to navigate to my departure gate with the utmost of ease. I will give you no points for guessing that I did not know that either and was quite certain I needed to rush through to my departure gate unless I wanted to miss my flight. Nowadays, every time I take a flight, I absolutely despise the people, who in their rush to get off the plane, undo their seat belts while the plane is taxiing, and stand in the aisle, pushing people aside so that they can be the first to get off. Ironically, I was one of those people when my flight touched down at Heathrow in London, brushing people aside, with gentle taps on a number of people's shoulders, accompanied with low repetitions of "excuse me please, I have a connecting flight". I wonder how many judgmental side glances I had received that day, similar to the ones that I give away for free, left, right and center now, something I am not too proud of.</p>

<p>Reasonably buzzed due to the one, two, or three beers I talked about earlier, deprived of any sleep, and panicking frantically to make it to my connecting flight, I set foot in the city of London, at the Heathrow aiprort. Even though it was only the airport, and my brain was functioning roughly at 50% of its capacity, my first thought was about a football team based in North London, Arsenal F.C, that I followed and still follow quite religiously, and just for a second, I was elated, Arsenal having recently won their first major trophy in almost a decade! After this brief moment of elation, I made my way through the crowd, looking at screens to find my next destination, and feeling utterly out of place among international travelers, who seemed almost annoyingly calm, as if they knew exactly what they needed to do, to get to where they wanted to. I, on the other hand, felt like a fish out of water, gasping for air, but not knowing what to do. Luckily, I was not alone in feeling this way. I had an old lady, who was travelling alone as well, who needed to make a connecting flight, and was not comfortable conversing in English, join me in my efforts to hunt for our respective gates. Funnily enough, she was a lot more calm and composed than I was, which was surprising to me honestly. She caught hold off an air hostess, who was British judging by her accent, but with Indian roots, comfortable with Hindi as well. Now while the old lady talked straight to the point and knew exactly where to go after her brief conversation, I had way too much to ask and talk about, unfortunately. After taking the train she told me to take, to get to my gate, which she was taking as well, I got down to talking about everything I was feeling at the moment, about how big a deal moving abroad was for me, or how much I was regretting the decision already, among other things, all in a 5 minute train ride. I blame the beers for this rather embarassing encounter. To her credit though, she was nice enough to listen to me, and also give me an encouraging pat on my shoulder, saying, 'you'll do fine, don't worry!'. That random act of kindness, instances of which are becoming increasingly rare in today's world, did put a smile on my face, even if only for a second. I bid her farewell, got off the train, and walked to my gate, with still a couple of hours to spare, relieved beyond words.</p>

<p>The connecting flight to Chicago was long but largely uneventful, if you don't count the additional beers I had I mean. After another 8 hours in the air, when the plane started to lose altitude for landing, I was suddenly hit by the realization, that this was it. I could already see the city of Chicago outside the window, becoming larger every second. And then of course, there was the usual panic of the landing, which I am all too accustomed to now, before the plane finally touched down and came to a halt. This was what over 6 months of hard work, which started from applications to Universities, comprised of dealing with a shitty job on the side, and also consisted of numerous disagreements with my father on a number of topics, culminated in. I was here! I was in the United States of America! The land of opportunities, the land of dreams! And for a brief period of time, which lasted roughly till about 5 minutes after immigration, I was elated again. I had done it! I had set foot in the land of opportunities and in doing so, even though there was still a long way to go before I could say I had made it in the USA; I had realized a long nursed dream of traveling to the States. After this short lived elation, reality hit me again. Had this been a boxing match between reality and me, the towel would have been thrown in a long time ago! After this latest bout with reality, I was told by the flight staff that I had to take a train to another terminal to get to my flight to Rochester. I had two huge suitcases and one small one, apart from my backpack; all of which I had to collect at Chicago and check them in again, because those were the rules. So, I had to drag 3 suitcases with two hands, a feat which was physically impossible. To make things extra fun, trolleys were not allowed to be taken out of the terminal or on to the trains. I am sure that had I been a witness of what I was doing at that time, I probably would have laughed my head off. I was basically taking one big and one small suitcase, and dragging them a few feet at a time, leaving behind the other larger one; then leaving those two at their new destination, and coming back to get the bigger one. It wasn't much fun at all as you can imagine.
I finally got to the escalator which led to the platform for the train and needless to say, made 3 trips up and down the escalator for each of my suitcases. So, now, I was on the platform, waiting for the train to take me to my connecting flight, looking like a proper refugee from one of the world wars, primarily due to the luggage I had around me. I probably could have built a bunker around me with my suitcases if I had wanted to. While I was catching my breath and simultaneously trying to figure out a strategy to get onto the train with my entire luggage, without pushing people aside or leaving anything behind, the train came into the platform, flushing all my strategy down the drain. Yet another struggle with the luggage ensued, after which, I finally got to my connecting flightâ€™s gate and checked in my luggage.</p>

<p>Amidst all this, I did have a phone in my possession, which was, in theory, supposed to work in the United States. But, of course, it decided not to. So there was no way for me to contact anybody except via payphones, which only accepted quarters, and I had none. While I was trying to figure out a way to get change for using the pay phones, I ran into another Indian student in the same plight, looking exhausted. We joined forces to collect quarters from a candy shop, buying candy we didn't need and asking only for quarters in change. This is when we found our own Indian version of a knight in shining Armour! A man from Hyderabad had been quietly observing us while we were running circles around the airport, and decided to offer us his phone! I was so relieved, as this act of kindness meant I did not have to count quarters we got as change anymore and quite honestly, I wasn't quite sure I would have been able to if I had to at that point of time.</p>
